[speaker:Joanna] Eschatology

<break time="1s"/>
[speaker:Joey] This album attempts to have an actual narrative and probably also succeeds... in having a narrative. The narrative itself is pretty basic, details are often left to interpretation and there probably isn't too much to be said about it. The way this narrative is told is via song titles. While the narrative is pretty dark in tone, the song titles try to be humorous to balance things a little. A lot of these song titles aren't very good though: Some are decent, most are ehhh and a lot are quite bad. I would like to say something like "They weren't as funny as I thought they were" but I never thought they were funny, I just thought that not having the aesthetic of funny song titles would make this album too depressing and thus I chose this aesthetic of funny without actually making a lot of them funny. I tend to do that sometimes. Maybe the failed humor is more depressing than just having matter-of-factly, serious, depressing song titles. But probably not.

Most of the songs themselves are also bad. All songs do in some way or another reflect their title but exclusively listening to the songs without reading along in the titles certainly doesn't really deliver the intended emotional experience of the narrative. A lot do evoke the general mood of the narrative but the specifics of situations are only rarely captured. Most songs are also bad as songs. Not interesting and not nice to listen to. Two stand out to me though: 'Compression Violence, or Your New Life Gently Dissolving Before Your Very Eyes' is kind of what 'Deteriorating Blossoms' wanted to be, though 'Compression Violence' is certainly more violent than its gentle deterioration. 'You Know, One Has to Build Some Tension to Make These Executions Satisfying to Watch and Everything' is, I think, just a pretty neat song. It doesn't really work too well as the end of this narrative but on its own or even as the closer for some other album I really like it. Might just be me though. There certainly seems to be a very specific type of song that I like the most on all these albums, except Blossoms I guess.

[speaker:Brian] The cover depicts psychedelic-ish colors that get swallowed up by blackness towards the right. The colors evoke something like a tunnel leading to maybe a light source. This isn't the canonical interpretation by the way, just a description generated while looking at the cover this very moment. I like the cover but there is something I regret deeply about it. There used to be another version of this cover; the one I originally made. But, as I noticed far too late, that version was made on a significantly too low resolution. I couldn't simply scale it up without making it look bad and thus I had to retrace the steps I took to create the cover in the first place just using a higher resolution. Sadly, I wasn't able to recreate the exact process. The covers do look very similar, but in the original one the transition to black is more dynamic and looks just a lot cooler on closer inspection. It is rather subtle and thus I used the high-resolution cover anyways but it annoys me nevertheless. What a missed opportunity.

[speaker:Amy] A lot of songs on 'Eschatology' were not written specifically for it but rather just chosen from my backlog of unreleased songs that fit the general vibe that I was going for in Eschatology. In general, most songs I make aren't yet for a specific album. Sometimes an idea for a complete, themed record emerges from the stuff that I already made and then I might make some songs for that specific release to fix any missing pieces. But on this album, that was even more the case because the only musical constraint was that the songs sound kinda depressing-ish and to be honest that's just most of my songs. Even some songs that didn't make it onto 'Beguiled by Guillotining' because they weren't good enough made it onto 'Eschatology' because the meaning of good changes when you have a concrete narrative in mind.

[speaker:Nicole] Talking about narrative, let's go into how the story for this album was made. I wanted to make an album with a concrete narrative for a while but without any concrete idea yet, I just made songs to see if something would naturally come up. The first piece that was put down was 'A Futile Attempt at Escaping' which was just a song I started making that turned out to sound like someone running away from something. It being an attempt at a prison break seemed natural and the part about the execution quickly followed. For a long time I just made songs that, as almost all of my songs do, generally fit the theme. It turned out that some work only in a specific point in the narrative but the narrative itself wasn't concrete yet. As my list of songs for this album grew and the projected release date came closer, I decided upon the concrete scenes I needed and categorized everything I had into these scenes assuming that I would need to make some more songs to round out places here and there. Some songs needed to be renamed to fit their new place in the story but, as it turned out, the songs I had already covered everything pretty well and the album was done, robbing this anecdote of any real climax.

[speaker:Amy] Talking about climaxes, here is a quick explanation of how the drumming on 'You Know, One Has to Build Some Tension to Make These Executions Satisfying to Watch and Everything' was generated because I think it is somewhat interesting. The approach is inspired by some aspects of Perlin Noise. It works by layering different drum parts of different "sizes" on top of each other. The size of a drum part determines both how often a sound is played and how loud that sound is played. Each drum part consists of exactly one sample being played according to the rhythm generated by the Euclidean Algorithm scaled by the size of the drum part. By playing enough of these parts at once and choosing the sizes according to some time-signature, this generates cool drumming. For more details, look into the source code of that song. Like every other song, it's open-source.

[speaker:Russell] You are currently listening to 'Song-Titles Are Like Comparisons, Some Are Better Than Others', a song that was originally made for Eschatology but didn't fit into any scenes. Next up, we have 'Sanity Escaping Again While The Body Still Stays Caught'.
