The Japanese always try to be innovative in some way.
reality is a modality that will be shown only once
studio Blade (of which nothing is known)
she decided to change the air
it doesn't drop much graphics
we must consider the unbalanced attributes of the protagonist
we will observe sudden changes from one image to another
keep the viewer quite awake
she actually lets herself be watched, even if she has a very superficial plot
it is possible to suddenly fail and psychologically collapse from one moment to the next

Yes, pathetic.
I am so done with these kinda people, it just pisses me off.
Why oh director WHY?

I watched both cause I lost a bet

It’s hilarious that I got screenshots of how she looks
so damn lifeless or regretting ever being there like she has a mind of her own
I shouldn't probably be criticizing

without any semblance of cognitive deviation
I'm not really sure how to express my level of dissatisfaction

What more can I say thats already been said
It reverts into an incestuous lovechild
Don't bother wasting your time.

Awful, apalling and disgusting.
its existence bothers me.

I thought that the most childish thing in the world was a child that was still inside your mother's belly
but also as anything else that generates war
brats who lose their mental insanity just to keep their desire and selfish determination
STOP !!!! YOU ARE ALREADY ON THE LIMIT !!! ENOUGH !!! MATURITY, ONLY !!! IS IT REALLY DIFFICULT THAT ?? TO HAVE THIS, AT LEAST A LITTLE, IS IT REALLY SO DIFFICULT THAT ??? MY GOD !!!
I'd rather kill myself in this war than be killed in it.

For God's sake, ARRIVE !!
Are you still called Otaku?
Are you by any chance Otaku? Because if not, what are you doing watching anime and on an anime site ????
You, Fanboys, who are doing this are not even Otakus.
If you still want to sustain 0.1% (at least) of your mindset, STOP !! ENOUGH !!
Disgust, just ...

Nobody I know understands the story now.
a weird turn into unhealthy obsession which I find creepy.
I felt that this stagnation started

incel weebs who couldn't talk to female for a living
all of the females are subservient
even the tsundere girl gives in to his demands.
would highly not recommend it.

I chucked on a random anime just to kill the silence
It's probably enjoyable if you like bad things or don't really care for quality,
it certainly tries at times to justify its existence
I just want to stop thinking

https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=378222



i dont think there's something to be understood here

without any intent of inputting constructive insight
Despite my lack of intent, I’ll try my best
If it somehow inspires or encourages, I’m not liable for it.
this isn’t to insult him but rather glorify him.
I was in for quite the kicker.
it was a surprise when this film didn’t place as much groceries on the table.
I wouldn’t call it a con but rather a drift
importing Christianity’s most glamorous product into the scene
it’d be appropriate to dub them the ‘Biblical Magi’
such an entailment would be a bit too ambitious to entail

https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=378282



A lot of them are psychopaths
It's honestly just sad.

https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=378546



a waste of my 40 minutes of time.
it just became annoying.
trash animation that looks like it got copy-pasted from Mario.

https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=378544



Story is terrible let's write that down
Characters. Ah chars!
They have no deepness on theirselves therefore you cant conenct them.

https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=378541



have fun watching people get killed.

https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=378537



I cant stand people saying that this anime is bad. Especially for the reasons why.
These people are missing the goddamn point.
so its unrealistic at all.
The whole anime is a message to gamers
in fact, multiple times me has gone against her judgement and came out a better man.
and now that hes trying, he doesnt think its trash anymore.

After the biggest letdown movies nr. 10 and 11 - EVER -
I couldn't even eat my popcorn properly
known as the Hulk of Animation.
there were some parts where absolutely no background music was playing
she has been degraded to a little crybaby
It will get you into the right mood

I was a different person back then,
they have no idea what is happening now.
He just wanted to be a hero to humanity.
he is saddened by everything
it has literal food
Like eating pizza, getting sauce all over your face, laughing, getting ice cream for the first time in your life,

https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=378506



Serialized story is lagging,
The embodiment of panty and pantyhose fetish.
go full speed and either die leaving atmosphere as a falling start in revers or crashing

https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=378494



adds all the new elements to it shows us in really well around way to be worthy being a great movie

https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=379090



talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before
beautiful. literally beautiful art.

You're saying that it's based on a visual novel and that they removed many important things compared to the novel ? Well, who cares ! i didn't read the visual novel so i don't care !

It is best if you do not take this show seriously at all.
Laugh at the cliches rather than criticise them.
you might as well just enjoy it while its there.

All right now if we start with this semi-review attempt.
First of all I want to touch the change of study that is not at all minor, since under no point is it from the Anime that it is.
I knew that it was very difficult for its current owner to overcome MadHouse
I felt very satisfied with what has been achieved.
little by little the shortcomings in the direction of the anime were noticed,
they were able not only to focus on a dense and "dark" plot (if it can be called that)
the straw that overflowed the glass
Someone explain to me why the hell did they start

https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=379066



The anime has a super normal footprint that any other anime could have
nothing new in its history.
But that is only in this matter.
I mean, in the middle of 2020, having a weak animation and horrendous like that is better to work as a thumb design or something below.
Or maybe how a podcast would have a better rating.
Anyway. It is not an innovative anime, nor is it nice to see, but it will leave a smile on your face, I guarantee that, so I recommend it.

https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=369174



Anyway, a simple change has elevated anime to heights, it's sad.
A goddess who serves only for the scenes that expose her buttocks and nothing else;
Anyway, no more to say about it.
The anime's evaluation is too absurd for it, but who am I to change that... It's a matter of being smart and evaluating something better.

https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=370211



It is sad to come here and see that, in the middle of the 11th century, we still have "anime analysts" here
on this site and anywhere else to desecrate an anime,
whatever it is and its perfection, it will be desecrated by a simple argument useless: "I did not like this work, DO NOT WATCH!"
Is that an opinion or a mandate? Please pity, disgusting beings.
it took away tears that I don't even know where they would be anymore.
I advise you not to go with the flow of those root analysts who call themselves otaku, but are nothing more than unofficial judges
Take into account emotions and not comparisons, anime is to brighten your day and not to be a REVIEW WORK!

https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=370352



HOWEVER, we must not forget that this is just a work of fiction.
If you were frustrated, then understand: THIS IS EXACTLY THE EXCENCE !!!
Don't you cry watching a movie? An anime? Don't you feel angry? Don't you feel sorry?
Changing the subject... The art of anime has nothing to complain about
you get a complete view of them and get to know them better, physically.
simple, differentiated and (perhaps) unique.
bullying + comedy + romance? Isn't it really a very... cool thing? I think.
The boy who is bullied by a GIRL and does nothing, does not even retort. Courage = 0.
The most "NORMAL", so to speak, would be the President.
Use this to reflect on your actions, if you identify with any of the characters.
you can resort to watching the anime.

If you don't like my review, don't read it.
Please, grow up.
This actually disgusted me.
the kids will be nightmares with you.
they both suck as human beings.

https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=272723



which takes the pleasure to the extreme
maybe I'm not very emotional
The sound... kamisama, THAT'S DELICIOUS !!
I believe it is the bridge that leads to tears, literally!
Okay, there's no way you don't like that.
