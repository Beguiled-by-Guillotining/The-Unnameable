[speaker:Joey] Blossoms is probably the most consistent release in this catalogue. Maybe too consistent. It's almost like the intersection of two concept-ish albums with how specific the concept is. It also arguably consists of two separate albums interleaved where one of these albums came from the intersection with yet another concept album or three. Okay... Let's maybe get a bit less confusing here for a minute:
As just said, the album consists of two interleaved parts: "Mainline Blossoms" and "Experimental Blossoms". "Mainline Blossoms" are ambient tracks using orchestral samples and a specific composition technique that another voice will explain more in a bit. They all have a very similar texture and mood. They aren't the best tracks ever made or anything but I generally like them; all of them are at least decent and 'Blossoms [2.]5' is easily the best one. Listening to a lot of Blossoms can feel pretty same-y though, none of them sound like anything you wouldn't expect. To offset that at least a bit, "Experimental Blossoms" are introduced. They use the same orchestral samples and composition technique but aim for something less ambient. I remembered them to be rather interesting for the most part but none of them really held up. 'Melancholic Blossoms' is bad; 'Skeleton Blossoms' and 'Skeleton Blossoms 2' are fine at best; 'Blossoms of Mounting Pressure' is weirdly unmemorable and 'Deteriorating Blossoms' doesn't produce as much interesting sound as I remember but I still generally enjoy it. So, yeah, that's the album: Decent but not good as I remember.

[speaker:Amy] The orchestral samples used here are from the Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra or SSO for short. 'Blossoms 1' was actually the first song I made using these and it seemed like a huge step forward from just using Sonic Pi's built-in synthesizers. Though, as sort of alluded to earlier, Blossoms wasn't the first release using these samples, rather that was 'Biblical Magi' from TMTASL. In comparison, the music on that song seems far worse than that on 'Blossoms 1'. Why did I not just use a modified Blossoms as the background music for 'Biblical Magi'? I don't really know.

Oh and just playing these samples isn't quite as trivial as it sounds. I use a kinda complicated program, originally written by Robin Newman and further modified by me, to play these samples in Sonic Pi as if they were a synth. One thing that this program can't replicate is the quasi-unlimited range of synths. These samples are only available for notes in specific, instrument-depended intervals and only have specific, instrument-depended lengths, which makes working with them more restrictive than with synthesizers. Restrictions can often lead to interesting solutions but in this case it mostly becomes annoying that a Cor Anglais can't play the 2 octaves of D3 minor used in 'Blossoms [2.]5'. But, well, that's just the price you have to pay for the freedom of using these samples. To quote someone else "Freedom is nothing soft and sweet, it's beautiful and terrible."

[speaker:Brian] The cover is a part of the Mandelbrot fractal, edited to evoke trees gently towering above you. It has a lot of empty space and I enjoy the composition. It's nothing eye-catching but that works well with the contents of the album and I don't see anything to be improved here without completely changing the entire image.

[speaker:Amy] Now, we will finally talk about the fabled "blossoms technique". How it works is that for each instrument, there is a melody that consists of a fixed number of notes and pauses of the same length each. This melody is played on repeat. Whenever a note or pause is played, it gets replaced by another note or pause with some probability. And that's essentially it. Now, different songs just consist of different instruments, number of notes, note lengths, scales, probabilities and potentially some additional features such as making a random instrument louder for periods of time. It's simple, versatile and works well for ambient-y songs. Buy your own "blossoms technique" today!

[speaker:Russell] You are currently listening to 'Blossoms [2.]5(.5)'. Coming up next, we have an unreleased song that doesn't use the blossoms technique but the same samples: 'An Ideology of Infinite Growth or... Timing error, can't keep up'.
