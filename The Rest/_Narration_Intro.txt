[speaker:Joanna] Hello, hello.
This is Beguiled by Guillotining.
This album and 'Yet to Be Untitled' mark the end of the a-musical-release-per-month project and also the end of Beguiled by Guillotining.
Not the end of me making music, just the end of this name. At least until the reunion tour or the release of an album called 'Beguiled by Guillotining in 2030' or something.

Thus, I think it will be interesting to look back at these last six months and examine what Beguiled by Guillotining even was in the first place.
So, we are going to reflect on each album in release order and, along the way, listen to some remade or remastered tracks from these albums as well as some completely new and extremely, entirely exciting unreleased songs.
Just grab a beverage, lean back and relax. Oh, and drink every time you hear a C3.
