[speaker:Joanna] Bootlag

<break time="1s"/>
[speaker:Amy] Bootlag was my first planned album project, even pre-'Beguiled by Guillotining', but in-between making 'Blossoms' and 'Eschatology' I dropped it. The idea was to create one song inspired by each song on the album Bootleg which is one of the soundtracks of the anime Serial Experiments Lain. It's a really good soundtrack.

[speaker:Brian] I even had some cover art for Bootlag. It was the cover of the original Bootleg redrawn in an intentionally bad way with the E replaced by a red A. It looked quite bad. And that was the point. But that didn't make it any better.

[speaker:Amy] I made a total of 4 songs for that album. One of these songs, originally titled 'Attendance' made it onto 'Eschatology' as 'Living the Life That You Are Actually Living Today'. Two were thrown away because they were completely terrible.
