[speaker:Joanna] Beguiled by Guillotining

[speaker:Joey] Ah, the good old days... This album is essentially just every non-terrible piece of music I had made up to that point and I think that clearly shows - both in good and in bad ways. There is no real coherence to this album. I tried to structure everything to some extent by grouping songs into whether they are chill, intense or something in between and mapping these moods to the three words in the name of the album. And that... kind of works I guess... It certainly makes it feel like there is some sort of structure to everything but it doesn't work well enough to really make this album more than a collection of songs. And a lot of these songs aren't that great or just plain uninteresting. But(!) there is a lot of experimentation, a lot of interesting ideas and some actually decent songs. Well, even most of the decent songs are rough around the edges and make some decisions that seem misguided in hindsight but one of them stands out as pretty much perfect and that is 'The Anxiety of Being'. At least to me it does; I doubt most people would agree.

[speaker:Amy] In that case, let's talk a little bit about 'The Anxiety of Being' first. This song comes from a particular mindset that I sometimes have where I just crave to listen to music with a lot going on and I mean A LOT. It's hard to explain but I haven't really found anything that satisfies my particular requirements in these moments but there are things that come close: 'Cryptooology' by 'Yowie' is a great album that throws a lot at you but it's slower parts (if you can call them that) are too slow and long for me to listen to them in this state of mind. Some songs by 'Polysics' do have the appropriate amount of stuff going on but their hyper-active positivity is often not the mood I seek. The music of 'Ruins' is almost perfect for this but it doesn't have quite enough stuff for when this feeling appears in one of its more extreme intensities. So, when this feeling overtook me once again, I sat down to make my own song that would make the feeling go away again. The pieces of 'The Anxiety of Being' quickly slotted into place as there really aren't too many of them: The song just consists of randomly chosen beat-loop-samples played at random speeds at the same time. Once you layer enough of these, individual characteristics fade into a uniform texture. 'The Anxiety of Being' didn't take too much tweaking; the first version I made in minutes at that time is almost identical to what ended up on the album. It still isn't always the right answer to this feeling but sometimes it is.

[speaker:Brian] The cover art for this album is passable I guess. It's some post processing done on perlin noise and that works as a metaphor for the songs - incorporating randomness and all that - but as a cover it is a bit boring. Also, the way the font is rendered looks quite rough and the font itself might also not be the best fit but it's alright.

[speaker:Amy] We should probably cast a quick glance at how I make music at all. Nearly all songs use pseudo-randomness to at least some extent. Thus, I think of my music-making process less like writing specific melodies or concrete rhythms or even just singular songs but rather creating a texture, defining a set of restrictions that a whole set of very similar songs must fulfill. Often that also means that these songs are potentially infinitely long. Of course, for an album I only record one of these similar songs and only for a finite amount of time because that usually expresses an adequate sampling of the variation that this set of songs can provide.

[speaker:Amy] The tool I use for making music is Sonic Pi, which is, and I quote, "a code-based music creation and performance tool". It is usually used for live-coding where you write code live to create sound, as if playing an instrument. As we will discuss in some more depth later, that is not my workflow. I write the code for a complete song and then record only the output of that final code. There is, however, another way in which I consider the music I make to be alive.
What I mean is that a song is not made in a strictly bounded interval of time and then finished. Rather, songs are always being tweaked, and occasionally even changed radically up until the moment of recording, even if they were considered quote-unquote "finished" at some point. Art is never finished, only abandoned, as they say. And maybe not even abandoned: Especially with this album, but to some extent also with all the coming ones, I make new versions of songs even after the release of their respective albums. That's how most of the remade and remastered content here was produced. And for 'Beguiled by Guillotining' there are a lot more of these updated versions that were not included here. On the one hand that is because I didn't want to make this any more bloated than it already is. But on the other, even more important hand, that is because a lot of these songs suck, mostly because the original song wasn't very good but sometimes also because the remix loses any interesting points of the original.

[speaker:Russell] With this, I will leave you to some uninterrupted seconds of this slightly upgraded version of 'Standing in a Field and Seeing Every Strand of Grass'. After that, 'Electric Bats Storming a Pernicious Bastion v1.1'.
